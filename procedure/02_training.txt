(1) Using the command line mode
# /path-to-caffe/build/tools/caffe train -solver ./model/solver_cmdline.prototxt -weights ./model/voc_fcn32s_trans_init.caffemodel -gpu 0

(2) Using the Python program
# python solve.py


NOTE:
a. You have to build Caffe with WITH_PYTHON_LAYER option.
b. When using the command line mode, you have to copy voc_layers.py to /path-to-caffe/python,
   otherwise you will get an error "ImportError: No module named voc_layers".
